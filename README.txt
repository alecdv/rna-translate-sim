HW1 submission contains 4 files:

rna_translate.py - function to translate RNA string into amino acid string

orf.py - function to translate DNA sequence into all possible open reading frame amino acid sequences.

SequenceReader.py - module with classes to assist with the translations.

rna_codon_tree.py - Nested dictionary implementation of a tree for codon - amino acid translation.


All files should be in the same directory when testing, as both orf and rna_translate import SequenceReader and rna_codon_tree.


See module specific README files for testing and implementation details.
